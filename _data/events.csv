Two strangers (one single American girl + one volunteer from the audience) transition from “It’s a Match!” to their first date within a matter of minutes. It’s awkward, it’s taboo, and it is definitely a funny story you’ll be telling your friends later. <br><br>This is an award winning, audience-interactive show, that exists on the border between stand-up, improv, and performance art. Olivia invites the audience to open their phones (and hearts!) by matching with her through a popular dating app, then takes one lucky suitor up onto the stage where they have a REAL FIRST DATE in front of a live audience-- an audience which is offering their every thought and criticism of the date via live poll.  Will they find love? Intimacy? Another one night stand? Every first date is different and entirely unpredictable.<br><br>American Single bravely explores the space between the personal and the private, while challenging its viewers to step out of their comfort zones in the name of true love. Can a real, honest connection be found under such artificial circumstances? American Single ventures to find out. <br><br>Reviews<br><br>""Question your online dating choices, question your dating habits, but don’t question if you want to see this show.

Doors 8 PM, $8 Advance, $10 Day of Show



With Mavens of Ceremony Junior Mintt and Comrade Barbie, the QCRC aims to showcase queer performers of all genders and backgrounds for our friends and neighbors, in a positive and affordable environment. 

Conveniently located off the L and M trains, The Footlight Bar of Ridgewood will host this most auspicious occasion, the debut of a decedent four hours’ traffic of our stage.

Here, we take the theatrical traditions from the courts of despots and tyrants, “illustrious patrons of the arts,” and claim them for every kind of audience. Here, the trappings of glitz and glam come second to the art of The Show. Many wild  performances are promised for all, the likes of which Netflix could never produce.

Also! Games, Comedy, and Vendors, featuring the jewelry of neighborhood staple the Prince Peacock.

The inaugural event will take place on the 26th of February, with doors opening at 8pm. $8 in advance, $10 at the door. ALL are welcome. For more info follow us @queenscountyroyalcourt on Instagram and Facebook or go to queenscountyroyalcourt.com. Online ticket sales coming soon!
