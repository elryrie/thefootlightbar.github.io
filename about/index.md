Ridgewood is a classic New York neighborhood in Queens with deep roots, filled with historic row houses, locally owned and operated small businesses, some that go back generations. The Footlight intends to blend old with new and is prepared to accommodate all genres of music with a custom installed sound system, quality sound engineers and a high quality back line. The bar strives to be a neighborhood friendly hot spot known for its inviting atmosphere and charming, knowledgeable staff. The mission of the creative individuals who operate this venue is to create a unique environment to inspire the community, as well as our staff, to take part in creative endeavors and continue to return for fun and engaging experiences. In every genre, including film, music, theater and comedy, we will continue to grow and evolve to meet community demands and support local artists with our diverse offerings of artistic and cultural experiences.

The Footlight is a 21+ establishment after 8PM. We do hold children's and all ages matinee events on occasion. We host a children's play group every Friday between 1&ndash;4PM as well as fitness classes Wednesday and Saturday including Yoga and Pound Fitness hosted by certified instructors.
