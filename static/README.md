# The `static` folder

This is a container for various static (unchanging) assets used in numerous places throughout your site, notably [images](images/README.md#the-images-folder), which are themselves kept in their own subfolders. For example, [the `css` folder](css/) contains [Cascading Style Sheets](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), while [the `js` folder](js/) contains [JavaScript](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) resources used by the templates on your website to give your site the "look and feel" you want. You can customize how your website looks by changing the code in the `css` folder.

Most often, you will be interacting with [the `images` folder](images/). That folder is a good place to upload new images, such as pictures you want to share or include in blog posts. Read more about [uploading images to the `images` folder](images/README.md#uploading-images).
